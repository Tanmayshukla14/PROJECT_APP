Banknote Authentication Web App:

This repository contains a Streamlit-based web application that predicts whether a banknote is authentic or fake based on its features. The app uses a machine learning model to make predictions, offering a user-friendly interface for anyone to interact with.

Overview:

Banknotes can have subtle differences that distinguish authentic ones from counterfeit. This project leverages machine learning to analyze numerical features of banknotes and classify them as authentic or fake.

Features of the App

1.Input Fields: Users can enter numerical values for the features of a banknote:
Variance,
Skewness,
Curtosis,
Entropy.
2.Prediction: The app predicts whether the note is authentic or fake.
3.Interactive UI: Built with Streamlit, itâ€™s intuitive and responsive.

Tech Stack

Programming Language: Python,
Web Framework: Streamlit,
Machine Learning Model: Pre-trained classifier (stored as classifier.pkl).

Libraries Used:

1.numpy for numerical operations
2.pickle for loading the model
3.streamlit for web application development.

How to Use the App

1.Input the Features:
Enter the values for Variance, Skewness, Curtosis, and Entropy into the respective input fields.
2.Make a Prediction:
Click on the "Predict The Result" button to classify the banknote as either:
"The Note is Authentic",
"The Note is Fake".
3.Enjoy the Results:
The app will display the result instantly, with a success or error message.

Model Details

The app uses a pre-trained machine learning model (classifier.pkl).
The model is trained on a dataset of banknote features.
It classifies banknotes as authentic (0) or fake (1) based on the provided features.

Future Enhancements

1.Add visualization for feature importance.
2.Extend support for additional datasets and models.
3.Deploy the app on platforms like Streamlit Cloud or Heroku for public access.
4.Add detailed error handling for invalid inputs.
