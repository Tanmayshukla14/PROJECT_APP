Banknote Authentication Web App:
This repository contains a Streamlit-based web application that predicts whether a banknote is authentic or fake based on its features. The app uses a machine learning model to make predictions, offering a user-friendly interface for anyone to interact with.

Overview:
Banknotes can have subtle differences that distinguish authentic ones from counterfeit. This project leverages machine learning to analyze numerical features of banknotes and classify them as authentic or fake.

Features of the App
Input Fields: Users can enter numerical values for the features of a banknote:
Variance
Skewness
Curtosis
Entropy
Prediction: The app predicts whether the note is authentic or fake.
Interactive UI: Built with Streamlit, itâ€™s intuitive and responsive.

Tech Stack
Programming Language: Python
Web Framework: Streamlit
Machine Learning Model: Pre-trained classifier (stored as classifier.pkl)

Libraries Used:
numpy for numerical operations
pickle for loading the model
streamlit for web application development

How to Use the App
Input the Features:
Enter the values for Variance, Skewness, Curtosis, and Entropy into the respective input fields.
Make a Prediction:
Click on the "Predict The Result" button to classify the banknote as either:
"The Note is Authentic"
"The Note is Fake"
Enjoy the Results:
The app will display the result instantly, with a success or error message.

Model Details
The app uses a pre-trained machine learning model (classifier.pkl).
The model is trained on a dataset of banknote features.
It classifies banknotes as authentic (0) or fake (1) based on the provided features.

Future Enhancements
Add visualization for feature importance.
Extend support for additional datasets and models.
Deploy the app on platforms like Streamlit Cloud or Heroku for public access.
Add detailed error handling for invalid inputs.
